What about having the getter line from the datailed view in the list view.
That is: Wed May 28 09:08:13 CEST 2003, from localhost:4444 to ****, output... etc

Becomes: GET /s.gif HTTP/1.1, from localhost:44444 to ***, output... etc

This information would quickly give me an overview over which get operation I want to see. All the getting of gifs and jpegs could then be avoided.

It could also be cool to be able to select multiple lines to delete with the new overview to quickly delete all gifs.

Besides that - great plugin -- AndersHolmbechNielsen - 28 May 2003

Anders' suggestion would only work for http based protocols - especially the filtering part. On my wishlist would be

A configurable format string for the header line. Normally,
I don't really care about the date part of the time stamp or the hostnames & port numbers,
but would much rather see e.g. the first 30 characters of the request or reply.
The format string could be a MessageFormat? string with a documented list of available
values. E.g.

0  Time of message - use {0,time} or {0,date}
1  Length of request
2  Length of reply
3  Local host name
4  Local port
5  remote host name
6  remote port
7  First 50 chars of request
8  First 50 chars of response
9  size of request
10  size of response
11  time elapsed in ms


a binary/text switch for messages, so that I could inspect binary messages going back & forth - e.g. for RMI calls.
But I agree - great plugin!
